# ☀️ Grid Master — Advanced Solar Designing, Installation & Integration System

**Grid Master** is a modern, high-performance web platform for solar systems engineering, rooftop 3D designing, equipment price cataloging, and turnkey installation & grid integration. Designed for both **Home (Residential)** and **Building (Commercial)** solar purpose requirements.

This repository is the full web application (a React + Vite + Tailwind + React Router multi-page app — every menu item opens its own page) — deployable directly from the repo root to Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.

## 🧭 Site Pages

| URL | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home — hero, stats, service highlights, process, reviews, call-to-action |
| `/services` | Services (Home / Building) |
| `/design-samples` | Design Samples & CAD blueprints |
| `/equipment` | Equipment & Prices with quote builder |
| `/calculator` | Solar system calculator |
| `/team` | Engineering team + Head Engineer visiting card |
| `/contact` | Contact details, booking and FAQ |

Menu links open real pages (no fast in-page scrolling); each page opens at the top with a soft fade-in.
Because these are real URLs the host must serve `index.html` for unknown paths — already configured for
Netlify (`netlify.toml`, `public/_redirects`) and Vercel (`vercel.json`). For a local static server use `npx serve -s dist`.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🏠 Dual Scope: Home vs Building
- **Home / Residential Solar**: 5 kW to 20 kW hybrid setups, 100% electricity bill offsets, silent lithium battery backup banks.
- **Building / Commercial**: 50 kW to 2+ MW commercial rooftop BIPV, high-voltage transformer hooks, ballasted racking, peak demand shaving.

### 2. 🧮 Interactive System Sizing Calculator
- Select purpose (**Home** or **Building**), slide to your rooftop area (sq ft) and monthly electricity bill.
- Capacity is sized from the bill **and capped by usable roof area** (with a clear note when the roof is the limiting factor).
- Instant results: monthly generation, monthly savings, payback period, 25-year net savings, and an itemized cost breakdown.
- One-click booking that carries the calculated design into the booking form.

### 3. 🛒 Hardware Catalog with Transparent Pricing + Quote Builder
- Component store with prices for panels, hybrid inverters, LiFePO4 batteries, and racking.
- Category filtering + live search.
- **Quote builder**: add equipment, adjust quantities with +/− steppers, see the live package total, then book installation with the exact package attached to the booking email and receipt.

### 4. 📅 Online Booking Engine
- Purpose (Home/Building), service type, preferred lead engineer, date (no past dates), time slot, contact & property details.
- Delivers to `contactgridmaster@gmail.com` through relays tried in order — the site's own mail relay first, then FormSubmit — so a single blocked or un-activated relay cannot lose a booking.
- **Honest status handling**: the confirmation screen only says "submitted successfully" when a relay confirmed it; otherwise it says the booking is saved and offers one-click retry, a pre-filled e-mail, WhatsApp and phone.
- A booking that could not be sent is stored on the device and re-sent automatically later (next visit / back online).
- Copy or download an official booking receipt (.txt) with the reference ID and equipment package.

> **Booking e-mails are not arriving?** See [`docs/booking-email-setup.md`](docs/booking-email-setup.md) —
> it explains the one-time FormSubmit activation, the permanent own-provider setup
> (`.env.example`), and how to recover bookings FormSubmit received but never delivered.

> **Want every customer who books tracked automatically in a spreadsheet?**
> See [`docs/customer-bookings-sheet-setup.md`](docs/customer-bookings-sheet-setup.md) — a
> backend-only addition that appends each booking (name, phone, email, property address,
> service, date/time, notes) as a row in a Google Sheet you own, downloadable any time as a
> real `.xlsx` file. It runs independently of the e-mail relay above and never touches the
> booking form, the confirmation screen, or any other part of the website.

### 5. 📐 Designing Samples & CAD Blueprint Viewer
- Residential and commercial case-study portfolio with filters.
- **Inspect CAD Blueprint modal**: technical spec tables, generation & CO₂ metrics, and engineering sign-off by **GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM** and **Ashish Kumar**.

### 6. 💳 Interactive 3D Digital Visiting Card
- Flippable 3D card for Head Engineer **GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM**.
- **Real scannable QR code** (opens a direct call to the Head Engineer).
- **Save vCard (.vcf)** button, copy contact details, credential badges.

### 7. 👨‍🔬 Engineering Roster, Testimonials & FAQ
- Team roster featuring **GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM** (Head Engineer) and **Ashish Kumar** (Solar Designer Engineer), plus a "Grid Master Standard" guarantees card, client reviews and an FAQ accordion.

### 8. 💬 Floating WhatsApp Button
- Always-visible WhatsApp contact button (bottom-right) that opens a chat with the Head Engineer's number (+91 7200745180) with a pre-filled message. Also used as a fallback when email delivery can't be confirmed.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build in dist/
```

### ⚠️ Important: Activate the booking email (one-time)
Bookings are delivered through [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co). **Before the first real booking can arrive**, the owner of `contactgridmaster@gmail.com` must:

1. Submit any booking from the live site (or trigger one from the local dev server).
2. Open the inbox of `contactgridmaster@gmail.com` — FormSubmit will send an **activation email**.
3. Click the **Activate** link in that email.

After activation, every booking submission is emailed as a clean table. Until activation happens, the site still shows the customer a reference ID and offers call/WhatsApp fallbacks, but the email itself will not be delivered.

## 💰 Pricing / Currency (Dual: ₹ primary, $ secondary)

Prices show **₹ (primary) with an ≈ $ equivalent** across the catalog, quote builder,
calculator and booking receipts — all driven by one config in
[`src/data/solarData.js`](./src/data/solarData.js):

```js
export const CURRENCY = {
  rate: 85, // ₹ per 1 USD (reference conversion)
  formatINR / formatUSD / inrFromUSD / usdFromINR
};
export const SOLAR_ASSUMPTIONS = { tariffPerKwhInr: 8, ... }; // calculator (INR-based)
```

- **Change the reference rate**: edit `CURRENCY.rate`.
- **Change an equipment price**: edit `priceINR` on the item in `EQUIPMENT_CATALOG` (`pricePerUnit` is the USD reference used for the ≈ $ display).
- **Change calculator assumptions** (tariff, cost per kW, battery cost): edit `SOLAR_ASSUMPTIONS`.

> The ≈ $ values are conversions at the reference rate — if you want exact fixed USD prices
> next to the ₹ prices, set them manually per item.

## 👤 Contacts & Leadership

- **Company**: Grid Master Solar Systems
- **Head Engineer**: GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM (Solar Designing Engineer & Electrical Engineer)
  - 📞 `+91 72007 45180`
  - ✉️ `goutham4518@gmail.com`
- **Solar Designer Engineer**: Ashish Kumar — `snazzy5566@gmail.com`
- **Headquarters**: Solar Tech Park, Suite 402, Clean Energy Corridor, Hyderabad

> Note: `contactgridmaster@gmail.com` is the booking receipt inbox configured in `COMPANY_INFO` — update it in `src/data/solarData.js` if you move to a company domain.
> Changing it also invalidates the FormSubmit activation for the old address, so re-run the
> one-time activation in [`docs/booking-email-setup.md`](docs/booking-email-setup.md), or set
> `MAIL_TO` to the new inbox with a mail provider configured.

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
npm test        # 47 tests: delivery engine, server relay, jsdom booking flows
npm run verify  # tests + production build
```

- `tests/bookingMail.test.mjs` — relay order, multipart-before-JSON transport, FormSubmit's
  activation/error answers, retry queue behaviour.
- `tests/serverRelay.test.mjs` — provider detection, mail rendering/escaping, handler
  validation, throttling, 501 fallback.
- `tests/apiAdapters.test.mjs` — the Vercel and Netlify entry points.
- `tests/dom/bookingFlow.test.mjs` — drives the real app in jsdom: opens the booking form,
  submits it, and asserts what goes on the wire and what the customer is told (including that
  a blocked or un-activated relay is **never** reported as a successful delivery).
