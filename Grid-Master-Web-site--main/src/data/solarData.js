    q: "How does Grid Master design custom solar systems for homes vs buildings?",
    a: "Our Head Engineer GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM and Senior Solar Designer Ashish Kumar create 3D CAD models using satellite roof geometry, local sun trajectory, and electrical load profiles. For homes, we focus on aesthetic alignment, silent battery backups, and 100% bill reduction. For commercial buildings, we engineer structural ballasted racking, high-voltage transformer connections, and peak-shaving economic models."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I choose my preferred solar panels, inverters, and batteries?",
    a: "Yes! Grid Master features an open equipment catalog with transparent pricing for top-rated TOPCon panels, hybrid inverters, and LiFePO4 batteries. You can select specific hardware during our online booking process or let GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM recommend the ideal configuration for your energy requirements."
  },
  {
    q: "Who conducts the initial site inspection and electrical engineering audit?",
    a: "All solar designs and single line electrical schematics are reviewed and certified directly under the supervision of GANDHAMANENI GOUTHAM, our Head Engineer (Solar Designing & Electrical Engineering), along with Ashish Kumar and our senior engineering roster."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the installation and grid integration process take?",
    a: "Residential home installations typically take 2 to 4 days on-site following design approval. Commercial building integrations range from 2 to 3 weeks depending on utility net-metering approvals and transformer hookups."
  },
  {
    q: "What warranties and guarantees does Grid Master provide?",
    a: "We offer a 25 to 30 year performance warranty on solar panels, 10 to 12 years on smart hybrid inverters, 10 years on lithium battery banks, and a 10-year Grid Master Guarantee on all installation workmanship and roof waterproofing."
